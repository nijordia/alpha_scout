## 📊 Metrics Explained

| Metric         | Description                                                                                   |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Win Rate**   | Percentage of signals that resulted in a profit after the preferred holding period.          |
| **Avg Return** | Average percentage return per signal, measured over the preferred holding period.            |
| **vs BH**      | Outperformance of the strategy compared to Buy & Hold over the same period.                  |
| **Max Drawdown** | Largest observed drop from peak to trough in the strategy's equity curve.                  |
| **Signal Count** | Number of signals generated by the strategy in the experiment period.                      |
| **Period**     | Timeframe analyzed for reliability and performance metrics.                                  |

**Preferred Period:**  
The preferred period is the number of days each signal is "held" when calculating reliability metrics. For example, if set to 30, the bot evaluates the return of each signal after 30 days.
